            <p><b>Pulse of Love and Hate</b> is an interactive data visualization + audiation of how Love and Hate appear in Twitter. Many of us spend some time reading at online news platforms and social medias, without knowing how biased, curated, or personalized the list of news we see. This project started from a simple question "Is the world actually feel this way? or is it the algorism of what I see?" This simple info-art lets us see the real number of one small aspect of people's emotional output: tweets. Come seeing them when you want to peak at how/what people love and hate at this moment.</p>

            <h3>:: LOVE vs HATE ::</h3>
            <p>This app counts number of all tweets with 'Love' and 'Hate' every day. Queries used for the search are below. Retweets, Replies, and tweets @mentioning other Twitter users and having outside links are excluded.</p>
            <p><b>LOVE</b> = Tweets including the keyword 'Love', and not including keywords 'hate' 'kill' 'die' 'murder' 'sex' 'disgusting' 'hatred' 'murder'</p>
            <p><b>HATE</b> = Tweets including the keyword 'Hate', and not including keywords 'love' 'happy' 'enjoy' 'warmth' 'sex' 'sweet' 'lovely' 'happiness'</p>
            <p>Real time new tweets of Love and Hate are displayed every 30 seconds.</p>

            <h3>:: Legend ::</h3>
            <p onmouseover="hateFocus()" onmouseout="hateUnFocus()">Hate chart is hanging down from the top of the screen</p>
            <p onmouseover="loveFocus()" onmouseout="loveUnFocus()">Love chart is showing up from the bottom of the screen</p>
            <p>You can move this handle to the left to change the date</p>
            <p>Music and atmospher color changes depending on the ratio and number of Hate and Love in the selected date. More Love = happier, more Hate = darker.</p>
            <p>The highest number of each Hate and Love are indicated with little bubbles</p>
