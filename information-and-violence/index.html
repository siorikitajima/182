            <p><b>Information and Violence</b> is an interactive data visualization showing a timeline of major U.S. news headlines along with gun sales and homicides from 2016. Since 2016, the numbers of gun sales and homicides has been steadily increasing. What is the cause? Could it be influenced by the media that we consume? By seeing violent information, does it make us more violent? Does violent information increase gun sales leading to more violence?</p>
